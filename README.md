# SIT378-Team_Project_B_AppAttack

Welcome to my SIT378 Team Project-B Github repository for the AppAttack project. This is a collaborative project driven by students undertaking this unit and led by me (Vansh Khanna) along with other fellows in a co-leadership role as a Senior at Hardhat Enterprises Company.

This repository serves as a centralized location for Vansh Khanna to store and manage his own project-related files, code, and documentation for the university assignments, as well as technical contributions to the team project at an individual level. It also allows anyone to track the project's member progress and collaborate effectively after asking for permissions.

## Project Aim

The primary aim of this unit course is to enhance students' knowledge and skills in pen-testing by providing them with theoretical concepts and practical training through Portswigger and TryHackMe.com such websites. This course focuses on conducting software testing on the Echonet environment to identify vulnerabilities, correct them by suggesting the modifications in the code, and generate a report highlighting the application's issues to improve website security.

Students at an individual level are expected to apply their upskilling expertise, collaborate with a team, and acquire essential skills in proactively identifying and resolving vulnerabilities while also improving the website's overall security. To achieve this, they will use various testing methods and tools like Burpsuite to discover vulnerabilities in Echonet Project Environment by applying theoretical concepts and ethical hacking skills learned during the upskilling phase or any past experiences of the pen-testing course.

The results of these analyses and creative problem-solving techniques are used to develop customized security solutions that can strengthen the application's defenses. The success of the pen-testing activity can be measured through evidence of vulnerabilities found and successfully fixed, as well as the implementation of robust security policies that protect Echonet from potential attackers.

Overall, the course emphasizes the practical application of theoretical concepts and ethical hacking skills to real-world problems, highlighting the importance of critical thinking, innovation, and collaboration in developing effective security solutions.

## Getting Started

To get started with the AppAttack project, the first step is to fork the "Echonet" main repository into one's github and then clone onto a local machine and set up a development environment using a Kali Linux virtual machine (VM). This project's setup folder provides a detailed instruction list on how to set up the base and testing environment in Purple Kali Linux VM, which will be used for testing purposes.

After setting up the 'Base Environment' as Kali in VM, the next step is to clone the "Echonet" repository onto the local machine and set up the testing environment, while enabling some extensions for smooth usage while testing, which can be seen under 'Extensions' folder. Detailed instructions are also available in the same place under the setup folder. Once the setup process is done, the it involves deploying the code onto a server, which will be used to generate one's own findings that would need to be addressed by developing solutions and making necessary code changes.
Alternatively, the pre-setup file done by one of the leads can be used to shorten the process, considerably.

Throughout the process, Terminal will be utilized as primary application to set it up.
